# =============================================================================
# Release Tool Configuration
# =============================================================================
# This file controls how the release tool generates release notes by managing:
# - Repository information and GitHub integration
# - Ticket extraction and consolidation policies
# - Version comparison and gap detection
# - Release note categorization and formatting
# - Output destinations (file, GitHub release, PR)

# =============================================================================
# Repository Configuration
# =============================================================================
[repository]
# code_repo (REQUIRED): The GitHub repository containing the code
# Format: "owner/repo" (e.g., "sequentech/voting-booth")
code_repo = "sequentech/step"

# ticket_repos: List of repositories where tickets/issues are tracked
# If empty, uses code_repo for tickets as well
# This is useful when tickets are tracked in different repos than the code
# Default: [] (uses code_repo)
ticket_repos = ["sequentech/meta"]

# =============================================================================
# GitHub API Configuration
# =============================================================================
[github]
# token: GitHub Personal Access Token for API authentication
# RECOMMENDED: Use GITHUB_TOKEN environment variable instead of storing here
# The token needs the following permissions:
#   - repo (for accessing repositories, PRs, issues)
#   - write:packages (if creating releases)
# How to create: https://github.com/settings/tokens
# Default: reads from GITHUB_TOKEN environment variable
# token = "ghp_..."

# api_url: GitHub API base URL
# Change this only if using GitHub Enterprise Server
# Default: "https://api.github.com"
# For GitHub Enterprise: "https://github.yourcompany.com/api/v3"
api_url = "https://api.github.com"

# =============================================================================
# Database Configuration
# =============================================================================
[database]
# path: Location of the SQLite database file for caching GitHub data
# The database stores PRs, commits, tickets, and releases to minimize API calls
# Relative paths are relative to the current working directory
# Default: "release_tool.db"
path = "release_tool.db"

# =============================================================================
# Sync Configuration
# =============================================================================
[sync]
# cutoff_date: Only fetch tickets/PRs created after this date (ISO format: YYYY-MM-DD)
# This limits historical data fetching and speeds up initial sync
# Example: "2024-01-01" to only fetch data from 2024 onwards
# Default: null (fetch all historical data)
cutoff_date = "2025-01-01"

# parallel_workers: Number of parallel workers for GitHub API calls
# Higher values = faster sync, but may hit rate limits more quickly
# Recommended: 5-20 depending on your API rate limit
# Default: 10
parallel_workers = 10

# clone_code_repo: Whether to clone the code repository locally for offline operation
# When true, the generate-notes command can work without internet access
# Default: true
clone_code_repo = true

# code_repo_path: Local path where to clone/sync the code repository
# If not specified, defaults to .release_tool_cache/{repo_name}
# Example: "/tmp/release_tool_repos/voting-booth"
# Default: null (uses .release_tool_cache/{repo_name})
# code_repo_path = "/path/to/local/repo"

# show_progress: Show progress updates during sync
# When true, displays messages like "syncing 13 / 156 tickets (10% done)"
# Default: true
show_progress = true

# =============================================================================
# Ticket Extraction and Consolidation Policy
# =============================================================================
# patterns: Ordered list of ticket extraction patterns
# Each pattern is associated with a specific extraction strategy (where to look)
# and uses Python regex with NAMED CAPTURE GROUPS (use "ticket" group for the ID)
#
# Patterns are tried in ORDER (by the "order" field). First match wins.
# Lower order numbers = higher priority. You can reorder by changing the numbers.
# TIP: Put more specific/reliable patterns first (lower order), generic ones last
#
# Available strategies:
#   - "branch_name": Extract from PR branch name (e.g., feat/meta-123/main)
#   - "pr_body": Extract from PR description text
#   - "pr_title": Extract from PR title
#   - "commit_message": Extract from commit message text
#
# Pattern structure:
#   [[ticket_policy.patterns]]
#   order = 1              # Priority (lower = tried first)
#   strategy = "branch_name"  # Where to look
#   pattern = "regex_here"    # What to match (use (?P<ticket>\\d+) for ID)
#   description = "explanation"  # Optional: what this pattern matches

# ORDER 1: Branch name (most reliable, structured format)
# Matches: feat/meta-123/main, fix/repo-456.whatever/develop
# Format: <type>/<repo>-<ticket_number>[.optional]/<target_branch>
[[ticket_policy.patterns]]

# Use this when the branch name doesn't follow convention
[[ticket_policy.patterns]]
order = 2
strategy = "pr_body"
pattern = "(Parent issue:.*?/issues/|sequentech/meta#)(?P<ticket>\\d+)"

# Valid values:
#   - "ignore": Silently skip the warning, include in release notes
#   - "warn": Print a warning but continue (RECOMMENDED for most teams)
#   - "error": Stop the release note generation with an error
# Default: "warn"
# Use "error" for strict ticket tracking, "warn" for flexibility

# unclosed_ticket_action: What to do with tickets that are still open
# Valid values:
#   - "ignore": Include open tickets in release notes without warning
#   - "warn": Print a warning but include them (RECOMMENDED)

# partial_ticket_action: What to do when a ticket is extracted but not found in DB
# or found in a different repository than expected
#
# "Partial matches" occur when:
#   - Ticket key extracted from branch/PR, but ticket not in database (common causes):
#     * Ticket created before your sync cutoff date
#     * Ticket doesn't exist (typo in branch name)
#     * Sync hasn't been run yet
#   - Ticket found in database, but in wrong repository:
#     * Branch says "meta-8624" but ticket is in "step" repo
#     * Mismatch between ticket_repos config and actual ticket location
#
# Valid values:
#   - "ignore": Silently skip partial matches, continue with next pattern
#   - "warn": Print detailed warnings with potential causes and ticket links (RECOMMENDED)
#   - "error": Stop release note generation if any partial matches found
#
# Default: "warn"
# When in warn mode, the tool will list:
#   - Which tickets had partial matches
#   - Whether they were not found or in different repo
#   - Potential reasons (cutoff date, typo, wrong repo, etc.)
#   - Links to tickets if found in different repos

# This checks if tickets in the new release already exist in semantically-earlier releases
# (e.g., creating 9.3.1 and finding tickets that already appeared in 9.2.0)
#
# This happens when a single ticket includes multiple PRs that land in different releases,
# or when backporting fixes to older release branches.
#
# Valid values:
#   - "ignore": Exclude duplicate tickets from the new release (keep only in earlier release)
#   - "warn": Include duplicates but show a warning (RECOMMENDED)
#   - "error": Stop release note generation if duplicates are found
#
# Default: "warn"
# Use "ignore" if you want strict deduplication (one ticket per release across history)
# Use "warn" for visibility into which tickets span multiple releases
inter_release_duplicate_action = "warn"

# consolidation_enabled: Group multiple commits by their parent ticket
# When true: Commits with the same ticket (e.g., TICKET-123) are grouped

# When false: Each commit appears as a separate entry in release notes
# Default: true
# RECOMMENDED: true (makes release notes more concise and readable)
consolidation_enabled = true

# description_section_regex: Regex to extract description from ticket body
# Uses Python regex with capturing group (group 1 is extracted)
# Looks for sections like "## Description" or "## Summary" in ticket text
# The tool gracefully handles tickets without description sections
# Default: r'(?:## Description|## Summary)\\n(.*?)(?=\\n##|\\Z)'
# Set to empty string "" to disable description extraction
# NOTE: In TOML, backslashes must be doubled: \\n becomes \\\\n, \\Z becomes \\\\Z
description_section_regex = "(?:## Description|## Summary)\\\\n(.*?)(?=\\\\n##|\\\\Z)"

# migration_section_regex: Regex to extract migration notes from ticket body
# Useful for database migrations, breaking changes, upgrade steps
# Looks for sections like "## Migration" or "## Migration Notes"
# The tool gracefully handles tickets without migration sections
# Default: r'(?:## Migration|## Migration Notes)\\n(.*?)(?=\\n##|\\Z)'

# =============================================================================
# Version Comparison and Gap Detection Policy
# =============================================================================
[version_policy]
# gap_detection: Check for missing versions between releases
# Detects gaps like 1.0.0 → 1.2.0 (missing 1.1.0)
# Valid values:
#   - "ignore": Don't check for version gaps
#   - "warn": Print a warning if gaps detected (RECOMMENDED)
#   - "error": Stop the process if gaps are detected
# Default: "warn"
gap_detection = "warn"

# tag_prefix: Prefix used for version tags in Git
# The tool will look for tags like "v1.0.0" if prefix is "v"
# Common values: "v", "release-", "" (empty for no prefix)
# Default: "v"
tag_prefix = "v"

# =============================================================================
# Branch Management Policy
# =============================================================================
# Controls how release branches are created and managed
[branch_policy]
# release_branch_template: Template for release branch names (Jinja2 syntax)
# Use {{major}}, {{minor}}, {{patch}} as placeholders
# Examples:
#   - "release/{{major}}.{{minor}}" → "release/9.1"
#   - "rel-{{major}}.{{minor}}.x" → "rel-9.1.x"
#   - "v{{major}}.{{minor}}" → "v9.1"
# Default: "release/{{major}}.{{minor}}"
release_branch_template = "release/{{major}}.{{minor}}"

# default_branch: The default branch for new major versions
# New major versions (e.g., 9.0.0 when coming from 8.x.x) will branch from this
# Common values: "main", "master", "develop"
# Default: "main"
default_branch = "main"

# create_branches: Automatically create release branches if they don't exist
# When true, the tool will create a new release branch automatically
# When false, you must create branches manually
# Default: true
create_branches = true

# branch_from_previous_release: Branch new minor versions from previous release
# Controls the branching strategy for new minor versions:
#   - true:  9.1.0 branches from release/9.0 (if it exists)
#   - false: 9.1.0 branches from main (default_branch)
# This enables hotfix workflows where release branches persist
# Default: true
branch_from_previous_release = true

# =============================================================================
# Release Notes Categorization
# =============================================================================
# Categories group release notes by the labels on tickets/PRs
# Each category can match multiple labels, and has a display order
#
# Label Matching with Source Prefixes:
# You can specify where labels should match from using prefixes:
#   - "pr:label_name"     = Only match this label from Pull Requests
#   - "ticket:label_name" = Only match this label from Tickets/Issues
#   - "label_name"        = Match from EITHER PRs or tickets (default)
#
# This is useful when PRs and tickets use the same label names differently.
# For example:
#   - PRs might use "bug" for any bug-related code change
#   - Tickets might use "bug" only for confirmed bugs needing fixes
#   - You can categorize them separately: ["pr:bug"] vs ["ticket:bug"]
#
# Category structure:
#   [[release_notes.categories]]
#   name = "Display Name"       # Shown in the release notes
#   labels = ["label1", "pr:label2", "ticket:label3"]  # With optional prefixes
#   order = 1                   # Display order (lower numbers appear first)

[release_notes]
# excluded_labels: Skip tickets/PRs with these labels from release notes
# Useful for internal changes, CI updates, etc.
# Default: ["skip-changelog", "internal"]
excluded_labels = ["skip-changelog", "internal", "wip", "do-not-merge"]

# title_template: Jinja2 template for the release notes title
# Available variables:
#   - {{ version }}: The version being released (e.g., "1.2.3")
# Default: "Release {{ version }}"
title_template = "Release {{ version }}"

# entry_template: Jinja2 template for each individual release note entry
# This is a POWERFUL template that lets you customize exactly how each change
# appears in the release notes. You can use Jinja2 syntax including conditionals,
# loops, filters, and all available variables.
#
# IMPORTANT: HTML-like behavior for whitespace and line breaks
#   - Multiple spaces/tabs are collapsed into a single space (like HTML)
#   - New lines in the template are ignored unless you use <br> or <br/>
#   - Use <br> or <br/> for explicit line breaks in the output
#   - Use &nbsp; for explicit spaces that won't collapse (e.g., &nbsp;&nbsp; = two spaces)
#   - This allows multi-line templates for readability while controlling output
#
# Available variables for each entry:
#   - {{ title }}           : The title/summary of the change (string)
#                             Example: "Fix authentication bug in login flow"
#   - {{ url }}             : Smart link prioritizing ticket over PR (string or None)

#                             Example: "https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/456"
#   - {{ short_link }}      : Short format link (string or None)

#   - Line breaks: Use <br> or <br/> for new lines in output
#   - Author fields: {{ author.username }}, {{ author.name }}, {{ author.mention }}
#
# Template examples:
#   1. Minimal (single line):

#
#   2. With PR link (single line):
#      entry_template = "- {{ title }}{% if url %} ([#{{ pr_numbers[0] }}]({{ url }})){% endif %}"

#      {% if url %}([#{{ pr_numbers[0] }}]({{ url }})){% endif %}
#      {% if authors %}<br>by {% for author in authors %}{{ author.mention }}{% if not loop.last %}, {% endif %}{% endfor %}{% endif %}'''

# release_output_template: MASTER Jinja2 template for GitHub release notes output
# This is an ADVANCED feature that gives you complete control over the release
# notes structure. When set, this template replaces the default category-based
# layout and lets you design your own custom format.
#
# WHEN TO USE:
#   - You want a custom layout (e.g., flat list, grouped by type, etc.)
#   - You need to iterate over migrations or descriptions across all tickets
#   - You want full control over the output structure
#
# IMPORTANT: HTML-like behavior for whitespace (same as entry_template)
#   - Multiple spaces collapse to single space
#   - Line breaks: Use <br> or <br/> for new lines in output
#   - Non-breaking spaces: Use &nbsp; for explicit spaces that won't collapse
#
# Available variables:
#   - {{ version }}      : Version string (e.g., "1.2.3")
#   - {{ title }}        : Rendered release title (from title_template)
#   - {{ categories }}   : List of category dicts with 'name' and 'notes'
#   - {{ all_notes }}    : Flat list of all note dicts (across categories)
#   - {{ render_entry(note) }}: Function to render a note using entry_template
#
# Each note dict contains:
#   - title, url (prioritizes ticket_url over pr_url), ticket_url, pr_url
#   - short_link (#123), short_repo_link (meta#123)
#   - pr_numbers, commit_shas, labels, ticket_key, category
#   - description, migration_notes (processed, may be None)
#   - authors (list of author dicts with all fields)
#
# Template examples:
#
#   1. Default category-based layout (equivalent to not setting output_template):
#      output_template = '''# {{ title }}
#
#      {% for category in categories %}
#      ## {{ category.name }}
#      {% for note in category.notes %}
#      {{ render_entry(note) }}
#      {% endfor %}
#      {% endfor %}'''
#
#   2. Flat list without categories:
#      output_template = '''# {{ title }}
#
#      {% for note in all_notes %}
#      {{ render_entry(note) }}
#      {% endfor %}'''
#
#   3. Custom layout with migrations section:
#      output_template = '''# {{ title }}
#
#      ## Changes
#      {% for note in all_notes %}
#      {{ render_entry(note) }}
#      {% endfor %}
#
#      ## Migration Notes
#      {% for note in all_notes %}
#      {% if note.migration_notes %}
#      ### {{ note.title }}
#      {{ note.migration_notes }}
#      {% endif %}
#      {% endfor %}'''
#
#   4. Grouped by ticket with full descriptions:
#      output_template = '''# {{ title }}
#
#      {% for note in all_notes %}
#      ## {{ note.title }}
#      {% if note.description %}
#      {{ note.description }}
#      {% endif %}
#      {% if note.url %}
#      **Pull Request:** [#{{ note.pr_numbers[0] }}]({{ note.url }})
#      {% endif %}
#      {% if note.authors %}
#      **Authors:** {% for author in note.authors %}{{ author.mention }}{% if not loop.last %}, {% endif %}{% endfor %}
#      {% endif %}
#      {% if note.migration_notes %}
#      **Migration:** {{ note.migration_notes }}
#      {% endif %}
#      {% endfor %}'''
#
#   5. Custom grouping with manual entry rendering:
#      output_template = '''# {{ title }}
#
#      ## Features & Fixes
#      {% for category in categories %}
#      {% if category.name in ["Features", "Bug Fixes"] %}
#      ### {{ category.name }}
#      {% for note in category.notes %}
#      {{ render_entry(note) }}
#      {% endfor %}
#      {% endif %}
#      {% endfor %}
#
#      ## Other Changes
#      {% for category in categories %}

# doc_output_template: Jinja2 template for Docusaurus/documentation release notes
# This optional template wraps the GitHub release notes with documentation-specific
# formatting such as Docusaurus frontmatter. It provides an additional render function
# to embed the GitHub release notes within the documentation format.
#
# WHEN TO USE:
#   - You want to generate Docusaurus documentation alongside GitHub release notes
#   - You need to add frontmatter (id, title, etc.) to the release notes
#   - You want different formatting for documentation vs GitHub releases
#
# IMPORTANT: HTML-like behavior for whitespace (same as release_output_template)
#   - Multiple spaces collapse to single space
#   - Line breaks: Use <br> or <br/> for new lines in output
#   - Non-breaking spaces: Use &nbsp; for explicit spaces that won't collapse
#
# Available variables (in addition to all release_output_template variables):
#   - {{ version }}                 : Version string (e.g., "1.2.3")
#   - {{ title }}                   : Rendered release title (from title_template)
#   - {{ categories }}              : List of category dicts with 'name' and 'notes'
#   - {{ all_notes }}               : Flat list of all note dicts
#   - {{ render_entry(note) }}      : Function to render a note using entry_template
#   - {{ render_release_notes() }}  : Function to render the GitHub release notes
#
# Template example for Docusaurus:
#   doc_output_template = '''---
#   id: release-{{version}}
#   title: {{title}}
#   ---
#   <!--

#   SPDX-License-Identifier: AGPL-3.0-only
#   -->
#   {{ render_release_notes() }}<br>'''
#
# Default: None (disabled - only GitHub release notes are generated)
# Uncomment and customize to enable Docusaurus output
# doc_output_template = '''---
# id: release-{{version}}
# title: {{title}}
# ---
# {{ render_release_notes() }}'''
