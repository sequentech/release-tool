# =============================================================================
# Release Tool Configuration
# =============================================================================
# This file controls how the release tool generates release notes by managing:
# - Repository information and GitHub integration
# - Issue extraction and consolidation policies
# - Version comparison and gap detection
# - Release note categorization and formatting
# - Output destinations (file, GitHub release, PR)

# =============================================================================
# Repository Configuration
# =============================================================================
[repository]
# code_repo (REQUIRED): The GitHub repository containing the code
# Format: "owner/repo" (e.g., "sequentech/voting-booth")
code_repo = "sequentech/step"

# issue_repos: List of repositories where issues/issues are tracked
# If empty, uses code_repo for issues as well
# This is useful when issues are tracked in different repos than the code
# Default: [] (uses code_repo)
issue_repos = ["sequentech/meta"]

# =============================================================================
# GitHub API Configuration
# =============================================================================
[github]
# token: GitHub Personal Access Token for API authentication
# RECOMMENDED: Use GITHUB_TOKEN environment variable instead of storing here
# The token needs the following permissions:
#   - repo (for accessing repositories, PRs, issues)
#   - write:packages (if creating releases)
# How to create: https://github.com/settings/tokens
# Default: reads from GITHUB_TOKEN environment variable
# token = "ghp_..."

# api_url: GitHub API base URL
# Change this only if using GitHub Enterprise Server
# Default: "https://api.github.com"
# For GitHub Enterprise: "https://github.yourcompany.com/api/v3"
api_url = "https://api.github.com"

# =============================================================================
# Database Configuration
# =============================================================================
[database]
# path: Location of the SQLite database file for caching GitHub data
# The database stores PRs, commits, issues, and releases to minimize API calls
# Relative paths are relative to the current working directory
# Default: "release_tool.db"
path = "release_tool.db"

# =============================================================================
# Pull Configuration
# =============================================================================
[pull]
# cutoff_date: Only fetch issues/PRs created after this date (ISO format: YYYY-MM-DD)
# This limits historical data fetching and speeds up initial sync
# Example: "2024-01-01" to only fetch data from 2024 onwards
# Default: null (fetch all historical data)
cutoff_date = "2025-01-01"

# parallel_workers: Number of parallel workers for GitHub API calls
# Higher values = faster sync, but may hit rate limits more quickly
# Recommended: 5-20 depending on your API rate limit
# Default: 10
parallel_workers = 10

# clone_code_repo: Whether to clone the code repository locally for offline operation
# When true, the generate-notes command can work without internet access
# Default: true
clone_code_repo = true

# code_repo_path: Local path where to clone/sync the code repository
# If not specified, defaults to .release_tool_cache/{repo_name}
# Example: "/tmp/release_tool_repos/voting-booth"
# Default: null (uses .release_tool_cache/{repo_name})
# code_repo_path = "/path/to/local/repo"

# clone_method: Method for cloning repositories
# Options:
#   - "https": Clone using HTTPS with GitHub token authentication
#              Recommended for GitHub Actions with GITHUB_TOKEN
#   - "ssh": Clone using SSH (git@github.com:owner/repo.git)
#            Requires SSH keys to be configured
#   - "auto": Try HTTPS first, fallback to SSH if it fails (DEFAULT)
#             Provides flexibility across different environments
# Default: "auto"
# Use case:
#   - GitHub Actions: Use "https" or "auto" (default)
#   - Local development with SSH keys: Use "ssh" or "auto"
#   - GitHub Enterprise: Use "https" with custom clone_url_template
clone_method = "auto"

# clone_url_template: Custom clone URL template for non-standard Git hosting
# Use {repo_full_name} as a placeholder for the repository (e.g., "owner/repo")
# This is useful for GitHub Enterprise or custom Git servers
# If not specified, uses standard GitHub URLs based on clone_method
# Default: null (uses github.com)
# Examples:
#   - GitHub Enterprise: "https://github.enterprise.com/{repo_full_name}.git"
#   - Custom Git server: "https://git.company.com/{repo_full_name}.git"
#   - SSH on custom port: "ssh://git@gitlab.company.com:2222/{repo_full_name}.git"
# clone_url_template = "https://github.enterprise.com/{repo_full_name}.git"

# show_progress: Show progress updates during pull
# When true, displays messages like "pulling 13 / 156 issues (10% done)"
# Default: true
show_progress = true

# =============================================================================
# Issue Extraction and Consolidation Policy
# =============================================================================
# patterns: Ordered list of issue extraction patterns
# Each pattern is associated with a specific extraction strategy (where to look)
# and uses Python regex with NAMED CAPTURE GROUPS (use "issue" group for the ID)
#
# Patterns are tried in ORDER (by the "order" field). First match wins.
# Lower order numbers = higher priority. You can reorder by changing the numbers.
# TIP: Put more specific/reliable patterns first (lower order), generic ones last
#
# Available strategies:
#   - "branch_name": Extract from PR branch name (e.g., feat/meta-123/main)
#   - "pr_body": Extract from PR description text
#   - "pr_title": Extract from PR title
#   - "commit_message": Extract from commit message text
#
# Pattern structure:
#   [[issue_policy.patterns]]
#   order = 1              # Priority (lower = tried first)
#   strategy = "branch_name"  # Where to look
#   pattern = "regex_here"    # What to match (use (?P<issue>\\d+) for ID)
#   description = "explanation"  # Optional: what this pattern matches

# ORDER 1: Branch name (most reliable, structured format)
# Matches: feat/meta-123/main, fix/repo-456.whatever/develop
# Format: <type>/<repo>-<issue_number>[.optional]/<target_branch>

# Use this when the branch name doesn't follow convention
[[issue_policy.patterns]]
order = 2

[issue_policy]
# no_issue_action: What to do when a commit/PR has no associated issue
# Valid values:
#   - "ignore": Silently skip the warning, include in release notes
#   - "warn": Print a warning but continue (RECOMMENDED for most teams)
#   - "error": Stop the release note generation with an error
# Default: "warn"
# Use "error" for strict issue tracking, "warn" for flexibility
no_issue_action = "warn"

# unclosed_issue_action: What to do with issues that are still open
# Valid values:
#   - "ignore": Include open issues in release notes without warning
#   - "warn": Print a warning but include them (RECOMMENDED)
#   - "error": Stop if any issues are still open
# Default: "warn"
unclosed_issue_action = "warn"

# partial_issue_action: What to do when a issue is extracted but not found in DB
# or found in a different repository than expected
#
# "Partial matches" occur when:
#   - Issue key extracted from branch/PR, but issue not in database (common causes):
#     * Issue created before your pull cutoff date
#     * Issue doesn't exist (typo in branch name)
#     * Sync hasn't been run yet
#   - Issue found in database, but in wrong repository:
#     * Branch says "meta-8624" but issue is in "step" repo
#     * Mismatch between issue_repos config and actual issue location
#
# Valid values:
#   - "ignore": Silently skip partial matches, continue with next pattern
#   - "warn": Print detailed warnings with potential causes and issue links (RECOMMENDED)
#   - "error": Stop release note generation if any partial matches found
#
# Default: "warn"
# When in warn mode, the tool will list:
#   - Which issues had partial matches
#   - Whether they were not found or in different repo
#   - Potential reasons (cutoff date, typo, wrong repo, etc.)
#   - Links to issues if found in different repos
partial_issue_action = "warn"

# inter_release_duplicate_action: What to do when a issue appears in multiple releases
# This checks if issues in the new release already exist in semantically-earlier releases
# (e.g., creating 9.3.1 and finding issues that already appeared in 9.2.0)
#
# This happens when a single issue includes multiple PRs that land in different releases,
# or when backporting fixes to older release branches.
#
# Valid values:
#   - "ignore": Exclude duplicate issues from the new release (keep only in earlier release)
#   - "warn": Include duplicates but show a warning (RECOMMENDED)
#   - "error": Stop release note generation if duplicates are found
#
# Default: "warn"
# Use "ignore" if you want strict deduplication (one issue per release across history)
# Use "warn" for visibility into which issues span multiple releases
inter_release_duplicate_action = "warn"

# consolidation_enabled: Group multiple commits by their parent issue
# When true: Commits with the same issue (e.g., ISSUE-123) are grouped
#            into a single release note entry
# When false: Each commit appears as a separate entry in release notes
# Default: true
# RECOMMENDED: true (makes release notes more concise and readable)
consolidation_enabled = true

# release_notes_inclusion_policy: Control which types of changes appear in release notes
# This is a list of change types to include. Valid values: "issues", "pull-requests", "commits"
#
# Change Types:
#   - "issues": Include commits/PRs that are associated with a issue/issue
#   - "pull-requests": Include PRs even if they don't have an associated issue
#   - "commits": Include direct commits that have no PR and no issue
#
# How it works:
#   - Changes are categorized by type: "issue", "pr", or "commit"
#   - Only changes whose type is in this list will appear in release notes
#   - Excluded changes won't appear in any category (including "Other")
#   - Excluded changes won't be counted in statistics
#   - Excluded changes are completely absent from the final output
#
# Common configurations:
#   1. Default ["issues", "pull-requests"] (RECOMMENDED):
#      ✅ Include: Commits/PRs with issues
#      ✅ Include: PRs without issues
#      ❌ EXCLUDE: Standalone commits (no PR, no issue)
#      Use case: Standard workflow where all significant work goes through PRs
#
#   2. Issues only ["issues"]:
#      ✅ Include: Commits/PRs with issues
#      ❌ EXCLUDE: PRs without issues
#      ❌ EXCLUDE: Standalone commits
#      Use case: Strict issue tracking, ignore untracked work
#
#   3. Everything ["issues", "pull-requests", "commits"]:
#      ✅ Include: All changes regardless of type
#      Use case: Small teams, less formal process, want complete history
#
#   4. PRs only ["pull-requests"]:
#      ✅ Include: PRs without issues
#      ❌ EXCLUDE: Commits/PRs with issues
#      ❌ EXCLUDE: Standalone commits
#      Use case: Unusual - only show untracked PRs
#
# Default: ["issues", "pull-requests"]
# This default works well for most teams using PR-based workflows
release_notes_inclusion_policy = ["issues", "pull-requests"]

# description_section_regex: Regex to extract description from issue body
# Uses Python regex with capturing group (group 1 is extracted)
# Looks for sections like "## Description" or "## Summary" in issue text
# The tool gracefully handles issues without description sections
# Default: r'(?:## Description|## Summary)\n(.*?)(?=\n##|\Z)'
# Set to empty string "" to disable description extraction
# NOTE: In TOML, backslashes must be doubled: \n becomes \\n, \Z becomes \\Z
description_section_regex = "(?:## Description|## Summary)\\n(.*?)(?=\\n##|\\Z)"

# migration_section_regex: Regex to extract migration notes from issue body
# Useful for database migrations, breaking changes, upgrade steps
# Looks for sections like "## Migration" or "## Migration Notes"
# The tool gracefully handles issues without migration sections
# Default: r'(?:## Migration|## Migration Notes)\n(.*?)(?=\n##|\Z)'
# Set to empty string "" to disable migration notes extraction
# NOTE: In TOML, backslashes must be doubled: \n becomes \\n, \Z becomes \\Z

# =============================================================================
# Version Comparison and Gap Detection Policy
# =============================================================================
[version_policy]
# gap_detection: Check for missing versions between releases
# Detects gaps like 1.0.0 → 1.2.0 (missing 1.1.0)
# Valid values:
#   - "ignore": Don't check for version gaps
#   - "warn": Print a warning if gaps detected (RECOMMENDED)
#   - "error": Stop the process if gaps are detected
# Default: "warn"
gap_detection = "warn"

# tag_prefix: Prefix used for version tags in Git
# The tool will look for tags like "v1.0.0" if prefix is "v"
# Common values: "v", "release-", "" (empty for no prefix)
# Default: "v"
tag_prefix = "v"

# =============================================================================
# Branch Management Policy
# =============================================================================
# Controls how release branches are created and managed
[branch_policy]
# release_branch_template: Template for release branch names (Jinja2 syntax)
# Use {{major}}, {{minor}}, {{patch}} as placeholders
# Examples:
#   - "release/{{major}}.{{minor}}" → "release/9.1"
#   - "rel-{{major}}.{{minor}}.x" → "rel-9.1.x"
#   - "v{{major}}.{{minor}}" → "v9.1"
# Default: "release/{{major}}.{{minor}}"
release_branch_template = "release/{{major}}.{{minor}}"

# default_branch: The default branch for new major versions
# New major versions (e.g., 9.0.0 when coming from 8.x.x) will branch from this
# Common values: "main", "master", "develop"
# Default: "main"
default_branch = "main"

# create_branches: Automatically create release branches if they don't exist
# When true, the tool will create a new release branch automatically
# When false, you must create branches manually
# Default: true
create_branches = true

# branch_from_previous_release: Branch new minor versions from previous release
# Controls the branching strategy for new minor versions:
#   - true:  9.1.0 branches from release/9.0 (if it exists)
#   - false: 9.1.0 branches from main (default_branch)
# This enables hotfix workflows where release branches persist
# Default: true
branch_from_previous_release = true

# =============================================================================
# Release Notes Categorization
# =============================================================================
# Categories group release notes by the labels on issues/PRs
# Each category can match multiple labels, and has a display order
#
# Label Matching with Source Prefixes:
# You can specify where labels should match from using prefixes:
#   - "pr:label_name"     = Only match this label from Pull Requests
#   - "issue:label_name" = Only match this label from Issues/Issues
#   - "label_name"        = Match from EITHER PRs or issues (default)
#
# This is useful when PRs and issues use the same label names differently.
# For example:
#   - PRs might use "bug" for any bug-related code change
#   - Issues might use "bug" only for confirmed bugs needing fixes
#   - You can categorize them separately: ["pr:bug"] vs ["issue:bug"]
#
# Category structure:
#   [[release_notes.categories]]
#   name = "Display Name"       # Shown in the release notes
#   labels = ["label1", "pr:label2", "issue:label3"]  # With optional prefixes
#   order = 1                   # Display order (lower numbers appear first)

[release_notes]
# excluded_labels: Skip issues/PRs with these labels from release notes
# Useful for internal changes, CI updates, etc.
# excluded_labels = [
#   "skip-changelog",
#   "internal",
#   "wip",
#   "do-not-merge",
#   "release",
# ]
excluded_labels = [
  "skip-changelog",
  "internal",
  "wip",
  "do-not-merge",
  "release",
]

# title_template: Jinja2 template for the release notes title
# Available variables:
#   - {{ version }}: The version being released (e.g., "1.2.3")
# Default: "Release {{ version }}"
title_template = "Release {{ version }}"

# entry_template: Jinja2 template for each individual release note entry
# This is a POWERFUL template that lets you customize exactly how each change
# appears in the release notes. You can use Jinja2 syntax including conditionals,
# loops, filters, and all available variables.
#
# IMPORTANT: HTML-like behavior for whitespace and line breaks
#   - Multiple spaces/tabs are collapsed into a single space (like HTML)
#   - New lines in the template are ignored unless you use <br> or <br/>
#   - Use <br> or <br/> for explicit line breaks in the output
#   - Use &nbsp; for explicit spaces that won't collapse (e.g., &nbsp;&nbsp; = two spaces)
#   - This allows multi-line templates for readability while controlling output
#
# Available variables for each entry:
#   - {{ title }}           : The title/summary of the change (string)
#                             Example: "Fix authentication bug in login flow"

#   - Line breaks: Use <br> or <br/> for new lines in output
#   - Author fields: {{ author.username }}, {{ author.name }}, {{ author.mention }}
#
# Template examples:
#   1. Minimal (single line):
#      entry_template = "- {{ title }}"
#
#   2. With PR link (single line):
#      entry_template = "- {{ title }}{% if url %} ([#{{ pr_numbers[0] }}]({{ url }})){% endif %}"
#
#   3. With GitHub @mentions (uses author.mention for smart @username or name):
#      entry_template = '''- {{ title }}
#      {% if url %}([#{{ pr_numbers[0] }}]({{ url }})){% endif %}
#      {% if authors %}<br>by {% for author in authors %}{{ author.mention }}{% if not loop.last %}, {% endif %}{% endfor %}{% endif %}'''
#
#   4. With author names and emails:

#      {% if migration_notes %}<br>  **Migration:** {{ migration_notes }}{% endif %}'''
#
# Default: Multi-line template with title, short_repo_link, and author mentions
# The whitespace will collapse, <br> tags create line breaks
# Uses author.mention which gives @username if available, otherwise falls back to name
# Uses short_repo_link for concise display (e.g., "meta#123" instead of full URL)

# release_output_template: MASTER Jinja2 template for GitHub release notes output
# This is an ADVANCED feature that gives you complete control over the release
# notes structure. When set, this template replaces the default category-based
# layout and lets you design your own custom format.
#
# WHEN TO USE:
#   - You want a custom layout (e.g., flat list, grouped by type, etc.)
#   - You need to iterate over migrations or descriptions across all issues
#   - You want full control over the output structure
#
# IMPORTANT: HTML-like behavior for whitespace (same as entry_template)
#   - Multiple spaces collapse to single space
#   - Line breaks: Use <br> or <br/> for new lines in output
#   - Non-breaking spaces: Use &nbsp; for explicit spaces that won't collapse
#
# Available variables:

# documentation_release_version_policy: Policy for generating documentation files for release candidates
#
# This controls how documentation files are generated when working with release candidates (RC versions).
# It only affects doc_output_path generation, NOT release_output_path (GitHub release notes).
#
# Valid values:
#   - "final-only" (DEFAULT): Generate documentation as if it were the final version
#     * RC documentation files use final version name (e.g., 11.0.0.md for 11.0.0-rc.1)
#     * Content compares against previous final version (e.g., 10.x.x)
#     * Each RC overwrites the same file, building up cumulative changelog
#     * Final version generates to the same file with complete changelog
#     * GitHub release notes still use standard comparison (RC.1 vs RC.0)
#
#   - "include-rcs": Generate separate documentation files for each RC
#     * RC documentation files include RC suffix (e.g., 11.0.0-rc.1.md)
#     * Content uses standard version comparison (RC.1 vs RC.0 or previous final)
#     * Each RC generates a separate file
#     * Final version generates to its own file (11.0.0.md)
#     * GitHub release notes use standard comparison
#
# Use Cases:
#   - "final-only": Best for Docusaurus/versioned docs where you want one file per version
#                   that gets updated as RCs progress to final. This ensures documentation
#                   always shows the complete changelog for the upcoming release.
#
#   - "include-rcs": Best when you want to document each RC separately, keeping history
#                    of what changed in each release candidate. Useful for detailed
#                    release tracking or when RCs are deployed to different environments.
#
# Example with "final-only" for version 11.0.0:
#   - Generate 11.0.0-rc.0:
#     * Doc file: docs/releases/11.0.0.md (compares 10.5.0 → 11.0.0-rc.0)
#     * GitHub release: 11.0.0-rc.0 (compares 10.5.0 → 11.0.0-rc.0)
#   - Generate 11.0.0-rc.1:
#     * Doc file: docs/releases/11.0.0.md (compares 10.5.0 → 11.0.0-rc.1, OVERWRITES rc.0 docs)
#     * GitHub release: 11.0.0-rc.1 (compares 11.0.0-rc.0 → 11.0.0-rc.1)
#   - Generate 11.0.0:
#     * Doc file: docs/releases/11.0.0.md (compares 10.5.0 → 11.0.0, OVERWRITES rc.1 docs)
#     * GitHub release: 11.0.0 (compares 10.5.0 → 11.0.0, complete changelog)
#
# Example with "include-rcs" for version 11.0.0:
#   - Generate 11.0.0-rc.0:
#     * Doc file: docs/releases/11.0.0-rc.0.md (compares 10.5.0 → 11.0.0-rc.0)
#     * GitHub release: 11.0.0-rc.0 (compares 10.5.0 → 11.0.0-rc.0)
#   - Generate 11.0.0-rc.1:
#     * Doc file: docs/releases/11.0.0-rc.1.md (compares 11.0.0-rc.0 → 11.0.0-rc.1)
#     * GitHub release: 11.0.0-rc.1 (compares 11.0.0-rc.0 → 11.0.0-rc.1)
#   - Generate 11.0.0:
#     * Doc file: docs/releases/11.0.0.md (compares 10.5.0 → 11.0.0)
#     * GitHub release: 11.0.0 (compares 10.5.0 → 11.0.0)

# The category with alias="other" serves as the fallback for any issues/PRs
# that don't match any other category labels. You can name it whatever you want
# (e.g., "Other", "Miscellaneous", "Other Changes"), but the alias MUST be "other".
#
# - name: Display name for this category (customizable)

# =============================================================================
# PR Code Generation Templates
# =============================================================================
# Configure multiple code generation templates. Each template generates a separate
# output file from the release notes data. This replaces the old doc_output_template
# and doc_output_path configuration with a more flexible array-based system.
#
# Template structure:
#   [[pr_code.templates]]
#   output_template = "Jinja2 template string"
#   output_path = "path/to/output.md"
#
# You can have multiple [[pr_code.templates]] entries to generate different outputs
# (e.g., Docusaurus docs, CHANGELOG.md, custom formats).

[pr_code]
[[pr_code.templates]]
# output_template: Jinja2 template for the output file content
# This is a POWERFUL template that gives you complete control over the output
# structure. Use Jinja2 syntax including conditionals, loops, filters, and all
# available variables.
#
# WHEN TO USE:
#   - Generate Docusaurus documentation with frontmatter
#   - Create custom changelog formats
#   - Generate multiple output files from the same release data
#   - Wrap release notes with additional metadata or formatting
#
# IMPORTANT: HTML-like behavior for whitespace
#   - Multiple spaces/tabs collapse to single space (like HTML)
#   - Line breaks: Use <br> or <br/> for explicit line breaks in output
#   - Non-breaking spaces: Use &nbsp; for spaces that won't collapse
#   - This allows multi-line templates for readability while controlling output
#
# Available variables:
#   - {{ version }}                 : Version string (e.g., "1.2.3")
#   - {{ major }}                   : Major version number (e.g., "1")
#   - {{ minor }}                   : Minor version number (e.g., "2")
#   - {{ patch }}                   : Patch version number (e.g., "3")
#   - {{ title }}                   : Rendered release title (from title_template)
#   - {{ year }}                    : Current year (e.g., "2025")
#   - {{ categories }}              : List of category dicts with 'name', 'alias', 'notes'
#   - {{ all_notes }}               : Flat list of all note dicts (across categories)
#   - {{ render_entry(note) }}      : Function to render a note using entry_template
#   - {{ render_release_notes() }}  : Function to render the default GitHub release notes
#
# Each note dict in all_notes or category.notes contains:
#   - title, url (prioritizes issue_url over pr_url), issue_url, pr_url
#   - short_link (#123), short_repo_link (meta#123)
#   - pr_numbers, commit_shas, labels, issue_key, category
#   - description, migration_notes (processed, may be None)
#   - authors (list of author dicts with all fields)
#
# Template examples:
#
#   1. Docusaurus with frontmatter (DEFAULT - wraps GitHub release notes):
#      output_template = '''---
#      id: release-{{version}}
#      title: {{title}}
